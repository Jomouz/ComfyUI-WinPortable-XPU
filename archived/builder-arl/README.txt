[DEPRECATED]
As of PyTorch 2.7.0, Arrow Lake-H support is now included 
in the main XPU package (PyTorch XPU + IPEX), eliminating 
the need for a separate package.

----

This folder uses a special PyTorch and IPEX 
for Intel Arrow Lake-H (Ultra Series 2 Mobile Processors).

This folder won't get much update as the 'builder' folder, 
since the 'builder' uses XPU PyTorch that fits most modern Intel GPU models.
